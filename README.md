# Phase 1 - Repo ⚡

The repositry is created to document and archive every task from phase 1 of training. Each task's materials are stored in a seperate directory. 📁🗄

#### Here's a brief overview of tasks completed:

### Task 1 

This task was intended to test applying basic C++ code. Basic I/O like `cout` & `cin` and for and while-loops where implented. Check Task 1's [README](<Task 1/README.md>) for more details on specific tasks.

### Task 2

The purpose of this task was to learn the basics of electronic devices, switching circuits, Proteus software.💡 Check [here](<Task 2/README.md>) for schematics.

### Task 3

#### The board, the myth and the legend; the **Arduino UNO**.  

This task included (ورقة و قلم معايا يا ست الكل)📃👨‍🍳:
* Piezoelectric buzzer
* Photo resistor
* Servo motor
* Regulators
* DC motors
* Ultrasonic sensors

Usage of these components paired with the Arduino UNO for implenting circuits found [here](<Task 3>). Each circuit was simulated using Tinkercad

### Task 4

#### "Let's learn", said some machine.⚙  

Python libraries for data analysis `pandas` and `matplotlib` were used in [Task 4.1](<Task 4/Task 4.1.ipynb>). 📈  
A chess game was created with a GUI using `pygame` in [Task 4.2](<Task 4/Task 4.2.py>).♟  
[Task 4.3](<Task 4/Task 4.3.ipynb>) introduced the concept of machine learning using Python and libraries like `sklearn`. 

### Task 5

#### "Communication is key" 📶

Two ~~legends~~ Arduino UNO boards, were communicating throught a third ~~legend~~ Arduino UNO. The first Arduino was communicating with the master arduino using I$^2$C protocol, and the second Arduino using **UART**. Click on [5.1.png](<Task 5/5.1.png>) for a photo of the connection diagram.  
Part 2 of the task was determining the digital output for an ADC. My solution is in [5.2.pdf](<Task 5/5.2.pdf>).

### Task 6 
Desigining an H-bridge motor driver using Altium designer. The PCB, schematic and BOM is found the directory [Task 6](<Task 6>).
