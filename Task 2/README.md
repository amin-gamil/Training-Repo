# Task 2 - Electronics
The purpose of this task was to learn the basics of electronic devices, and simulating circuits using Proteus.âš¡

### Task 2.1 

This circuit implements a simple DC power supply. The switching can be implented using an NPN or a PNP transistor. Both schematics are shown: ðŸ’¡
