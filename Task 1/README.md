# Task 1 â€“ C++ Basics
This task was intended to test applying basic C++ code.

### Task 1.0

Implements basic `cout` and `cin`. Writing a string "Name" will lead to an output of "Hello, Name".  

### Task 1.1  

Implements a simple while-loop and `string(i, '*')` for printing an aestrisk a number of times. A pyramid of aestrisks is printed

### Task 1.2

An array is initialized and values are input using a for-loop and `cin`, then a target value is input. Using linear search, the target value's index is determined.

### Task 1.3

Determining the element of greatest value in an array using `*max_element(arr, arr + n)`.

### Task 1.4

Two 2D matrices are initialized (psst, they're actually 1D ðŸ¤«). A 'score' for each team is represented in each element and comparisons are done on an element-by-element basis. The winning team is the one with the most winning comparisons.
